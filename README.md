# Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a memory game using React. The application's UI is split into four components.

### Instructions

1. The application renders a dozen different images to the screen. 

2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once. 

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented.

4. If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0
.
5. The application keeps track of the users Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score.
